# Artemis Code Challenge

## Don't Kill the Tree

Don't let your tree die! Use arrow keys to move the tree left and right. The tree's health bar in the top left will count down. Collect sun, water and carbon dioxide to increase the tree's health. See how long you can last!

## Currently Implemented

The following is what's currently implemented in the game. The player character (tree) moves horizontally on the field. As the heath bar drops, the tree's sprite updates to show 3 stages of health.

There are 3 temporary mobs in place to attempt to catch. The mobs move with gravity (too fast), and do not currently have collisions on them.

The timer is in the header area, but currently does not update time.

## Usage

1. Clone repo
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`

After a few seconds, the game will open in the default browser.
